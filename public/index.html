              Fill in a row with a five letter word, then press "Enter". 
              If that word is found in our dictionary: 
              (1) the background of the letters within the correct word & in the right position of the word will be UCLA Blue, 
              (2) the background of the letters within the correct word but not in the correct position will be UCLA Gold, 
              (3) the remaining backgrounds will be USC Red. 
              The goal of the game is to get the all backgrounds to be UCLA Blue 
              (meaning you have guessed the correct word). 
              Good luck!! :)

      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
